Before we can use your code, you must sign the Google Individual Contributor
License Agreement, also known as the CLA, which you can easily do online.  The
CLA is necessary mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, even
after your contribution becomes part of our codebase, so we need your
permission to use and distribute your code.  We also need to be sure of various
other things--for instance that you will tell us if you know that your code
infringes on other people's patents.  You do not have to sign the CLA until
after you have submitted your code for review and a member has approved it, but
you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.

Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than
the one above: the Google Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License
Agreement.  Please get your company to sign this agreement instead if your
contribution is on their behalf.
